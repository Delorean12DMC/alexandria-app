<h1 align=center>Alexandria</h1>

Alexandria is an open source application for downloading and converting EBooks.

**NOTE** Currently Alexandria costs me around $3 monthly, and even if it may not be a huge amount, here in
Ecuador it is a considerable amount, plus I'm a college student and don't actually have a salary. That is why
I would very much appreciate any donations you could make, every cent helps. Thank you!

**Features**

- Search for your favorite titles and download them
- Can't find your favorite book in the right format? No problem, builtin EBook converter

**Anti-features**

- Uses some non-free sources for downloading books. Specifically, Alexandria uses Libgen.
  Libgen is considered a [shadow library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library).
- Uses a custom-made proprietary API for converting books from one format to another. I will
  consider open-sourcing this once it's mature enough.

## Install from F-droid

Download the F-droid app from [their website](https://f-droid.org/) and search for Alexandria.
